# Introduction

This report presents the results of the 2023 Galactic 2D Seismic Imaging Study Phase 2b, conducted by Devito Codes Ltd for Woodside Energy Ltd. The study aimed to benchmark the state of the art in seismic imaging using towed-streamer seismic data of limited quality acquired in shallow-water environments. The goal of this project is to asses the 
maturity of modern wave-equation based imaging techniques and software for the processing of non trivial field datasets. In particular, we will focus on the application of the inverse scattering imaging condition [@witte2017EAGEspl] to image directly data with strong, shallow surface related multiples. We will evaluate the quality of reverse time migration, sparsity promoting least-squares migration and time probed subsurface offset image gathers. The latter being one of the big challenges of subsurface imaging due to its extreme cost. Validating the usability of these algorithms would prepend to improved workflows and the computation of better interpretable images of the subsurface.

## Objectives


The following objectives and deliverables were agreed upon in the Statement of Work (SOW) between Devito Codes Ltd and Woodside Energy Ltd (Woodside) for the 2023 Galactic 2D Seismic Imaging Study Phase 2b:


::: {#fig-legacy}

![](./figures/legacy_pstm.png)

Legacy prestack time migration image of Line 18. The objective of this project is to improve on the focusing and resolution of the subsurface image through wave-equation based imaging.
:::


- To contribute towards a wider project that aims to:
   - benchmark the state of the art when it comes to seismic imaging using towed-streamer seismic data of limited quality acquired in shallow-water environments; and
   - allow Woodside Energy Ltd (the Company) and the wider industry to gauge the future potential of emerging technologies for seismic imaging when applied to towed-streamer seismic data of limited quality acquired in shallow-water environments.

- Devito Codes to demonstrate the capabilities of wave-equation based imaging when using shallow-water towed-steamer seismic data, and to advance those capabilities for the circumstances of the 2D field dataset to be provided by Woodside

- Imaging is applied directly to the raw data with multiple without the use of conventional data processing and multiple removal.

- The aim is a final seismic image that is superior (better resolved, more accurate, less noisy) to that produced by conventional workflows and technologies that will be applied during a parallel phase of the wider project. The reference image (pres-stack time migration) we aim to improve on is shown in @fig-legacy.


## Deliverables

Devito Codes should provide:

- Subsurface images and subsurface offset gathers for Line 18.
- Report detailing and demonstrating the techniques applied and parameters used throughout the project.
- Reproducible script to replicate the results.

# Data processing

We applied a standard data processing workflow in order to improve the quality of the images of the subsurface. Those processing steps are generally considered standard for any field data processing workflow. The  survey consists of 32 sail lines of raw navigation-merged gathers available in one SEG-Y file per line. In addition, some legacy stacks and models were provided:

- A pre-stack time-migration model for each line. We observed that the SEGY trace and file header of those models is likely to be incorrect as the time-sampling had to be quartered to obtain acceptable time-to-depth converted models instead odf the expected halving for two-way travel times. Those models were only used as initial migration models to get an idea of the subsurface but were later on replaced by models derived from wells and horizons.

- Time-migrated stacks. The dataset came with some migrated lines. Those migrated images were, however, not used, and instead, RTMs were generated with the time-migration velocity models. Despite inaccurate travel times, those RTMs are higher quality in terms of focusing and horizon continuity for the given velocities. We provide those migrated images for references that were intended to be used to train generative networks.


We show each step of the data processing in @fig-process for a shot record  in the middle of Line 18.


## Source wavelet

The wavelet provided with the dataset was used for all imaging procedures. The wavelet was filtered to a [3Hz, 40Hz] frequency band using a causal Butterworth filter of order five and shifted by 50ms to match the data acquisition time shift. This wavelet represents a theoretical far-field signature without a source ghost, modelled using the source array specifications and instrument impulse response. We found this provided wavelet to accurately match the direct wave and first arrival for a broad range of frequency [3Hz-60Hz] and therefore decided new source estimation was not necessary.

## Deblending correction

The dataset was truncated to 9 seconds, recording out of the 10 seconds of available data due to deblending artifacts in the tail end of the shot record for over 50% of the shots in line 18. We show in @fig-data the deblending artifact at the tail end of the shot record for illustration.


::: {#fig-data layout-nrow=2}

![](./figures/data-arti.png)


Deblending artifact. The next shot record can be seen starting at about 9.5 seconds leading to erroneous processing and imaging. The effect of this late deblending artifact can be seen in the initial subsurface image @fig-rtmc-init as an amplitude imbalance in the right part of the model. 
:::

Since there is very limited energy at later arrival and with the presence of strong multiples, truncating the last second of recording leads to a negligible loss in inversion and imaging accuracy.

## Filtering

The data were filtered between 3 Hz and 40 Hz to remove strong low frequency noise. We used a causal Butterworth filter of order 5 to match the source filtering. The dataset show good quality data and small level of noise after low pass filtering. The quality of the filtered data is expected to lead to near noise-free images of the subsurface, and our imaging workflow confirmed this observation with migrated section showing focused reflectors and very little noise and artifacts.

## 2D correction

Amplitude correction was performed on the field data for 2D imaging to compensate for the difference in spherical spreading of the amplitudes between two-dimensional and three-dimensional waves. A time gain of order one was applied to all traces with a 50ms shift to compensate for the recording 50ms delay in the data. Such correction corresponds to the difference in far-field amplitudes between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional Green's function in a constant medium. This is a conventional processing step and was, therefore, automatically applied to all experiments.

## Direct arrival mute

The direct wave was muted out of the data using a $1.6\mathrm{km}.\mathrm{s}$ water velocity using an exponential taper along time to avoid introducing high frequencies in the muted shot records. This mute leads to subsurface image with a reduce imprint of the turning waves, reducing low frequency tomographic events in the image, and sharper shallow imaging reducing the imprint of the source and receiver direct correlation.

# Imaging

The data were migrated with an isotropic acoustic model parameterized by P-wave velocity and density. The P-wave velocity was obtained with FWI by S-Cube (during Phase 2a of the overall project) and the density model derived using Gardner relationship from the velocity model. Density was set constant to $1 \mathrm{kg}.\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ in the water layer for the entire line. We use the inverse scattering imaging condition (ISIC) [@doi:10.1190/segam2012-0779.1;@witte2017EAGEspl] for both reverse time migration and subsurface offset gathers. This imaging condition is interpretable as imaging the seismic impedance and leads to high frequency images without tomographic artifacts. The resulting image is easier to interpret and show better continuity a nd focusing of fine layered reflectors.

## Initial checkshot velocity model

The initial checkshot model was obtained from the provided checkshot and mapping the velocity values to the horizons extracted from the legacy time migration images. The processing of the checkshot data and the generation of the velocity model was done by S-Cube (Phase 2a of the overall project) and provided to us. The model is sampled on a $12.5\mathrm{m}$ grid in both direction and is $95\mathrm{km}$ by $65\mathrm{km}$.

The initial checkshot velocity model was used to generate the impedance image shown in @fig-rtmc-init.

The subsurface offset gathers obtained with this model are shown in @fig-ssoc-init later on. The velocity model was obtained from the provided checkshot `Checkshots_NTP86_Area.xlsx` and mapping the velocity values to the horizons extracted from the legacy time migration images. The processing of the checkshot data and the generation of the velocity model was done by S-Cube and provided to us.

We see the limitations of the initial model in the impedance image and the subsurface offset gathers. The impedance image is no lining up with the velocity model below 2km depth. The subsurface offset gathers are not well focused and the events are not well aligned.

:::


Base on these initial results, it was clear the multiple steps are necessary for the processing of this dataset.

- 1) First an end-to-end FWI inversion of the velocity model is necessary to provide a more accurate background model. A first pass of FWI was performed based on an acoustic isotropic model. The resulting velocity should provide much better insight and lead to more precise and interpretable images of the subsurface and the RTM  and subsurface offset gathers computed with this resulting velocity will give insight on the quality of the FWI model and what part of the model require more processing and better inversion.

- 2) Due to the shallow water environment, strong multiples are present in the datasets.  All work was done incorporating those multiples into tThe inversion (FWI) and imaging (RTM, CIGs) processes are as follows: However, in order to obtain high quality images, future processing may require either multiple elimination workflows (i.e. Surface-related multiple elimination (SRME), Robust estimation of primaries by sparse inversion (REPSI, [@lin2013GEOPrepsi]), ...) or more complex physics, namely elastic isotopic, and later on anisotropic if necessary, to accurately model the shallow ocean bottom reflections and multiples.

## Final checkshot velocity model

The initial model used for this final result is once again obtained from the checkshot and horizons. Compared to the initial checkshot velocity model, this model was modified taking into account the data match and the RTM and subsurface offset gather computed wit the first model. The subsurface impedance image from this initial checkshot model is shown below. The continuity and sharpness of the events imaged in the subsurface are improved compared to the model at the start of the project. The main event at 4km depth is continuous and well resolved. However, the shallow section lacks focusing and continuity and the deeper part (below 4km) is very noisy.

:::

## Final velocity model

We now show the image obtained with the final FWI velocity model and make two main observations; first, the main horizon at 4km depth is more focused and continuous for the leftmost 40km of the model. The strong reflectors at 1km and 1.5km are now continuous across the full model and the faults at 35km and 60km are very well resolved. Additionally, we observe an overall increase in focusing and reflector continuity for the shallow part of the model (first 2.5km) and better match betwenn the velocity model and seismic image. However, the horizon at 4km depth losses structure starting at 40km and we observe a lot of ringing artifact between 70km and 90km likely to be multiple-related.

:::

Based on this image, the velocity model obtained with FWI is likely to be polluted by the multiples, and the smooth initial model leads to fewer artifacts from misplaced or duplicated reflectors in the hard final background model. Imaging in a smoothed version of the final model could lead to better subsurface image and would have been the next step in analyzing the quality of the inverted velocity.

# Sparsity promoting LSRTM

Model-space sparsity promoting least square migration [@witte2017EAGEspl, @herrmann2009GEOPcbm] is an iterative imaging method that uses the linearized Bregman algorithm [@lorenz2013linearizedbregmanmethodsplit] with the Curvelet transform as a sparsifying transform. The algorithm is designed to use a small subset of the dataset at each iteration leading to a total imaging cost equivalent to a single RTM. We intend to show that this advanced method leads to accurate true amplitude subsurface images at a reasonable computational cost.
The data were processed using the steps described in the Data Processing section. In addition, we added a data muting to remove all turning waves from the field data using a water velocity of 1500m/s.

![RTM](./figures/final/RTM_xwi-54-125_novp.png)

Impedance SPLSRTM in the final inverted velocity model and the RTM image in the same model for reference.
:::

We see limited benefits of SPLSRTM based on this image. However, this result comes from a plain application of the existing algorithm without the proper design of preconditioners. We however know that adding extra preconditionners necessary for handling field data properly will lead to improved accuracy of the subsurface and should resolve the main complexities such as the main unconformity at 4km depth.


**Notes on source estimation**

The initial goal was to integrate source estimation into the SPLSRTM algorithm based on the exisiting work in [@se-splsrtm]. However, our experiment showed that this algorithm will require significant rework to handle data with a complex source signature and strong, shallow, ocean bottom multiples. This method currently tries to estimate the source based on the entire shot record and needs to be refined for smaller subsets of the data for more robust estimation.

\newpage

# Subsurface offset image gathers

Subsurface offset gathers have been computed using random trace estimators [@timeprobe]. This method is a memory frugal but accurate way to compute adjoint based subsurface images such as Reverse Time Migration (RTM) and subsurface image gathers. The aim is to show that we can compute accurate CIGs with a method that requires little resources (very low memory) allowing for scaling to large subsurface areas and high frequencies unlike traditional CIG methods and frameworks. The data were processed as described in the Data Processing section and we computed the CIGs for a [3Hz, 40Hz] frequency band with 12.5m fine grain offset sampling between -1.5km and 1.5km for a total of 241 offsets. 

## Checkshot gathers


The probed subsurface offset gather shows clear evidence of un-focusing. This is a clear indication that the initial velocity model is not accurate enough to provide a good image of the subsurface. The events are not well aligned and the gathers are not well focused. This also indicates that despite good continuity, the main reflection at 4km depth in the impedance image cannot be considered correct but rather a consequence of a globally incorrect background model.


::: {#fig-ssoc-init}
![](./figures/cshot-init/SSO_chsot_ofs.png)

:::

## Final gathers

Finally, we computed the subsurface offset gather using low memory trace estimation (see ...) as with the initial checkshot model. As intended, the energy is much more focused around the zero offset hinting at a more kinematically accurate model. The events are well aligned and the gathers are well focused. The events are also well aligned with the impedance image and the velocity model. This is a clear indication that the final velocity model is much more accurate than the initial model and provides a much better image of the subsurface.

:::


**Notes**:

We note that the zero offset section of the probed gather is not as precise as the impedance image where this should not be the case. We assume the the presence of strong multiples in the data led to inaccuracies in the estimation of the probing vectors leading an impaired subsurface image. This observation will be studied to improve the image while conserving the scalable advantages of the method.

\newpage

# Machine learning

**Dataset preparation for generative AI**

A stretch target for this phase of the project was to evaluate the potential of new machine learning methods and in particular, the potential of generative AI to obtain background velocity model from simple information which would avoid time consuming by hand analysis of the data to generate initial models for FWI and imaging. In this case, the intended goal is to generate velocity model for the area covered by the 32 lines from the few wells and RTMs obtained with the time migration model. Given the experimental nature of this work, development of this technology will continue beyond the Galactic Seismic Imaging Study and any results shared with Woodside via peer-reviewed publications.


**Uncertainty quatification**

A second objective was to use modern machine learning techniques to compute uncertainties for the inverted velocity models and subsurface images. However, due to the complexity and size of the model, the direct application of more academic algorithms was not immediately possible due to computational resources and lack of access to training data. One of the avenues we intend to explore in the future is to exploit work that consider variations around a given model (i.e an FWI final model) to compute uncertainty based on the variations of the corresponding RTMs [@siahkoohi2021dbif;@yin2022ML4SEISMICavc]. We intend to evaluate such techniques using the velocity model used for the final images. A second method we intend to explore is WISE [@yin2023wise], a very recent method based on subsurface offset gathers. This method is however in its infancy and will require generation of proper dataset and training to be used for this dataset, so is beyond the scope of this project.

\newpage

# Conclusions

Based on the objectives of this project, we successfully demonstrated the benefits of wave-equation based imaging with there inverse scattering imaging condition. First, we showed that we can obtain accurate, focused and high frequency images of the subsurface free of tomotgraphic artifacts. Additionaly, we showed that we can image with the raw data, including free-surface multiple, and obtain accurate images with limited imprint of the multiples. However, we discovered that the probing techinique used to compute subsurface offset gathers does suffer from the surface-related multiple from the data leading to inaccurate subsurface images. This realization will be beneficial to improving the algorithm by designing better probing vectors in the presence of multiples. Second, we observed a general shift in the subsurface offset gathers computed with the raw data. This shift can likely be attributed to two main characteristics of the model. One, the overall dip of the model hints to a dip correction to the offset as we currently compute horizontal offset. We might consider estimating local dip from the velocity model to compute the shifted correlation along the dip. Second, the presence of shallow  multiples in the data is likely to strongly correlate secondary reflections with the primary wavefield. Overall, the quality of the images demonstrates the benefit of wave-equation based imaging and justify the additional cost associated with it, compared to traditional time/depth migration methods.
