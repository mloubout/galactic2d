abstract = {Abstract Thanks to continued performance improvements in software and hardware, wave-equation-based imaging technologies, such as full-waveform inversion and reverse-time migration, are becoming more commonplace. However, widespread adaptation of these advanced imaging modalities has not yet materialized because current implementations are not able to reap the full benefits from accelerators, in particular those offered by memory-scarce graphics processing units. Through the use of randomized trace estimation, we overcome the memory bottleneck of this type of hardware. At the cost of limited computational overhead and controllable incoherent errors in the gradient, the memory footprint of adjoint-state methods is reduced drastically. Thanks to this relatively simple to implement memory reduction via an approximate imaging condition, we are able to benefit from graphics processing units without memory offloading. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on acoustic two- and three-dimensional full-waveform inversion examples and on the formation of image gathers in transverse tilted isotropic media.},

	abstract = {The extremely large size of typical seismic imaging problems has been one of the major stumbling blocks for iterative techniques to attain accurate migration amplitudes. These iterative methods are important because they complement theoretical approaches that are hampered by difficulties to control problems such as finite-acquisition aperture, source-receiver frequency response, and directivity. To solve these problems, we apply preconditioning, which significantly improves convergence of least-squares migration. We discuss different levels of preconditioning that range from corrections for the order of the migration operator to corrections for spherical spreading, and position and reflector-dip dependent amplitude errors. While the first two corrections correspond to simple scalings in the Fourier and physical domain, the third correction requires phase-space (space spanned by location and dip) scaling, which we carry out with curvelets. We show that our combined preconditioner leads to a significant improvement of the convergence of least-squares {\textquoteleft}wave-equation{\textquoteright} migration on a line from the SEG AA{\textquoteright} salt model.},

	abstract = {Reverse-time migration (RTM) with the conventional cross-correlation imaging condition suffers from low-frequency artifacts that result from backscattered energy in the background velocity models. This problem translates to least-squares reverse-time migration (LS-RTM), where these artifacts slow down the convergence, as many of the initial iterations are spent on removing them. In RTM, this problem has been successfully addressed by the introduction of the so-called inverse scattering imaging condition, which naturally removes these artifacts. In this work, we derive the corresponding linearized forward operator of the inverse scattering imaging operator and incorporate this forward/adjoint operator pair into a sparsity-promoting (SPLS-RTM) workflow. We demonstrate on a challenging salt model, that LS-RTM with the inverse scattering imaging condition is far less prone to low-frequency artifacts than the conventional cross-correlation imaging condition, improves the convergence and does not require any type of additional image filters within the inversion. Through source subsampling and sparsity promotion, we reduce the computational cost in terms of PDE solves to a number comparable to conventional RTM, making our workflow applicable to large-scale problems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Least-squares reverse-time migration is well known for its capability to generate artefact-free true-amplitude subsurface images through fitting observed data in the least-squares sense. However, when applied to realistic imaging problems, this approach is faced with issues related to overfitting and excessive computational costs induced by many wave-equation solves. The fact that the source function is unknown complicates this situation even further. Motivated by recent results in stochastic optimization and transform-domain sparsity promotion, we demonstrate that the computational costs of inversion can be reduced significantly while avoiding imaging artefacts and restoring amplitudes. While powerful, these new approaches do require accurate information on the source-time function, which is often lacking. Without this information, the imaging quality deteriorates rapidly. We address this issue by presenting an approach where the source-time function is estimated on the fly through a technique known as variable projection. Aside from introducing negligible computational overhead, the proposed method is shown to perform well on imaging problems with noisy data and problems that involve complex settings such as salt. In either case, the presented method produces high-resolution high-amplitude fidelity images including an estimate for the source-time function. In addition, due to its use of stochastic optimization, we arrive at these images at roughly one to two times the cost of conventional reverse-time migration involving all data.},

	abstract = {We propose to use techniques from Bayesian inference and deep neural networks to translate uncertainty in seismic imaging to uncertainty in tasks performed on the image, such as horizon tracking. Seismic imaging is an ill-posed inverse problem because of unavoidable bandwidth and aperture limitations, which that is hampered by the presence of noise and linearization errors. Many regularization methods, such as transform-domain sparsity promotion, have been designed to deal with the adverse effects of these errors, however, these methods run the risk of biasing the solution and do not provide information on uncertainty in the image space and how this uncertainty impacts certain tasks on the image. A systematic approach is proposed to translate uncertainty due to noise in the data to confidence intervals of automatically tracked horizons in the image. The uncertainty is characterized by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and to assess these uncertainties, samples are drawn from the posterior distribution of the CNN weights, used to parameterize the image. Compared to traditional priors, in the literature it is argued that these CNNs introduce a flexible inductive bias that is a surprisingly good fit for many diverse domains in imaging. The method of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics is employed to sample from the posterior distribution. This method is designed to handle large scale Bayesian inference problems with computationally expensive forward operators as in seismic imaging. Aside from offering a robust alternative to maximum a posteriori estimate that is prone to overfitting, access to these samples allow us to translate uncertainty in the image, due to noise in the data, to uncertainty on the tracked horizons. For instance, it admits estimates for the pointwise standard deviation on the image and for confidence intervals on its automatically tracked horizons.},

It is of great importance to quantify the uncertainty in seismic imaging result from various background models. With Fourier neural operators as a learned surrogate, this continuation from a given background model to an unseen background model can be quite accurately estimated with near-zero cost. However, the limitation of the prior art is that the input background model and the survey area are assumed to be fixed. The main contribution of this work is to extend the Fourier neural operator surrogate to be amortized over different given background models and survey areas. We verify the effectiveness of our learned surrogates by a realistic example on different areas of Parihaka dataset against different background models.},
